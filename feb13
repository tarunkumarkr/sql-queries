Find Duplicate Employee Names (SQL + Logic)
Given a table Employee(id, name, department, salary)

Part A:
 
Write an SQL query to find names that appear more than once.

 SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Employee
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

 
Part B:
 
Write an SQL query to find the most repeated employee name based on department.
SELECT e.department, e.name, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Employee e
GROUP BY e.department, e.name
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
    SELECT MAX(cnt)
    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
        FROM Employee e2
        WHERE e2.department = e.department
        GROUP BY e2.name
    ) t
);
